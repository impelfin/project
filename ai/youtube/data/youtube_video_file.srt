1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,500
So, I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack, and all it requires of

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,520
you is this, that you change your posture for two minutes.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,520
But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body

4
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
and what you're doing with your body.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,700
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,060
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs, maybe you're wrapping your ankles.

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,220
Sometimes we hold on to our arms like this.

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,419
Sometimes we spread out.

9
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:51,380
I see you.

10
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,880
So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,660
We're going to come back to that in a few minutes, and I'm hoping that if you sort of

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,180
learn to tweak this a little bit, it could significantly change the way your life unfolds.

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,099
So we're really fascinated with body language, and we're particularly interested in other

14
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,779
people's body language.

15
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:21,019
You know, we're interested in, like, you know, an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous

16
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:27,699
glance or maybe a very awkward wink, or maybe even something like a handshake.

17
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:32,139
Here they are arriving at number 10, and look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands

18
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:34,019
with the President of the United States.

19
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:43,019
Oh, and here comes the Prime Minister of the ... No.

20
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:49,180
So a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and

21
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,019
weeks, even the BBC and the New York Times.

22
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,699
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language, but we call it

23
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,620
nonverbals as social scientists, it's language.

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,379
So we think about communication.

25
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,300
When we think about communication, we think about interactions.

26
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,220
So what is your body language communicating to me?

27
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,100
What's mine communicating to you?

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,300
And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,139
So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language

30
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,660
or other people's body language on judgments.

31
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,699
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.

32
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:31,380
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes, like who we hire or promote,

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,059
who we ask out on a date.

34
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:39,339
For example, Nalini Ambati, a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:46,699
30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgments of the physician's

36
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,860
niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued.

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,179
So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent, but

38
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:57,779
do we like that person and how they interacted?

39
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:03,619
Even more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates'

40
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:12,500
faces in just one second predict 70% of US Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes.

41
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,059
And even, let's go digital, emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to

42
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:21,380
claim more value from that negotiation.

43
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,460
If you use them poorly, bad idea.

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,100
So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others, how they judge us, and

45
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,460
what the outcomes are.

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,860
We tend to forget, though, the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's

47
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,339
ourselves.

48
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:41,740
We are also influenced by our nonverbals, our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.

49
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,580
So what nonverbals am I talking about?

50
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,399
I'm a social psychologist, I study prejudice, and I teach at a competitive business school.

51
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:54,820
So it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.

52
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,979
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance.

53
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,740
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?

54
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,619
Well, this is what they are.

55
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:08,619
So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.

56
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:14,059
So you make yourself big, you stretch out, you take up space, you're basically opening

57
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,059
up.

58
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,420
It's about opening up.

59
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,940
And this is true across the animal kingdom.

60
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,899
It's not just limited to primates.

61
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,299
And humans do the same thing.

62
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:28,940
So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically, and also when they're

63
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,160
feeling powerful in the moment.

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,660
And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these

65
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,779
expressions of power are.

66
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:44,179
This expression, which is known as pride, Jessica Tracy has studied, she shows that

67
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:49,339
people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they

68
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,380
win at a physical competition.

69
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,579
So when they cross the finish line and they've won, it doesn't matter if they've never seen

70
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:56,720
anyone do it, they do this.

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,459
So the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.

72
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:01,820
What do we do when we feel powerless?

73
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,779
We do exactly the opposite.

74
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,600
We close up, we wrap ourselves up, we make ourselves small.

75
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,980
We don't want to bump into the person next to us.

76
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,459
So again, both animals and humans do the same thing.

77
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,160
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power.

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,799
So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we compliment the other's nonverbals.

79
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:26,679
So if someone's being really powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller.

80
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:29,359
We don't mirror them, we do the opposite of them.

81
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:35,000
So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom, and what do I notice?

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,079
I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals.

83
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,579
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas, like really coming into the room,

84
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,059
they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts, like they really

85
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,339
want to occupy space.

86
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:56,459
When they sit down, they're sort of spread out, they raise their hands like this.

87
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,299
You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in.

88
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:01,140
As soon as they come in, you see it.

89
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,220
You see it on their faces and their bodies.

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,739
And they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when

91
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,660
they raise their hand.

92
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,179
I notice a couple things about this.

93
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:14,540
One, you're not going to be surprised, it seems to be related to gender.

94
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,140
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.

95
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,940
Women feel chronically less powerful than men, so this is not surprising.

96
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,940
But the other thing I notice is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which

97
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,700
the students were participating and how well they were participating.

98
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,660
And this is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half a grade.

99
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,700
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.

100
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:47,459
You get these equally qualified women and men coming in, and then you get these differences

101
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,260
in grades, and it seems to be partly attributable to participation.

102
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,220
So I started to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this

103
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,739
and they're participating.

104
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:02,140
Is it possible that we could get people to fake it, and would it lead them to participate

105
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,140
more?

106
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,980
So my main collaborator, Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley, and I really wanted to know,

107
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
can you fake it till you make it?

108
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,579
Can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that

109
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,420
makes you seem more powerful?

110
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,820
So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us.

111
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
There's a lot of evidence.

112
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:29,739
But our question really was, do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves?

113
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,380
There's some evidence that they do.

114
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,980
So for example, when we smile when we feel happy, but also when we're forced to smile

115
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,980
by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.

116
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,579
So it goes both ways.

117
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,500
When it comes to power, it also goes both ways.

118
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:56,220
So when you feel powerful, you're more likely to do this, but it's also possible that when

119
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:03,019
you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful.

120
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:08,700
So the second question really was, we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it

121
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,980
also true that our bodies change our minds?

122
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,660
And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about?

123
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,859
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that

124
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:24,220
make up our thoughts and feelings, and in my case, that's hormones.

125
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,540
I look at hormones.

126
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,260
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?

127
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:38,299
So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly, more assertive and more confident, more optimistic.

128
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,419
They actually feel that they're going to win even at games of chance.

129
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,059
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly, so there are a lot of differences.

130
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,059
They take more risks.

131
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,340
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people.

132
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,020
Physiologically, there also are differences.

133
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,820
There are two key hormones, testosterone, which is the dominance hormone, and cortisol,

134
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,900
which is the stress hormone.

135
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:10,419
So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone

136
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:17,619
and low cortisol, and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low

137
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:18,619
cortisol.

138
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:19,619
So what does that mean?

139
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,099
When you think about power, people tended to think only about testosterone because that

140
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:28,099
was about dominance, but really, power is also about how you react to stress.

141
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:32,940
So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant, high on testosterone, but is really

142
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,500
stress-reactive?

143
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Probably not, right?

144
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,500
You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant, but not very stress-reactive,

145
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,299
the person who's laid back.

146
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:51,580
So we know that in primate hierarchies, if an alpha needs to take over, if an individual

147
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,380
needs to take over an alpha role, sort of suddenly, within a few days, that individual's

148
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,219
testosterone has gone up significantly, and his cortisol has dropped significantly.

149
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:05,619
So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial

150
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:10,940
level, and also that role changes can shape the mind.

151
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,140
So what happens, okay, you take a role change, what happens if you do that at a really minimal

152
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,140
level?

153
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,179
Like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention, for two minutes you say, I want you to stand

154
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:24,380
like this, and it's going to make you feel more powerful.

155
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,020
So this is what we did.

156
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,979
We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment, and these people

157
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:38,820
adopted for two minutes either high-power poses or low-power poses, and I'm just going

158
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,739
to show you five of the poses, although they took on only two.

159
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:47,260
So here's one, a couple more.

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,179
This one has been dubbed the Wonder Woman by the media.

161
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,179
Here are a couple more.

162
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:57,900
So you can be standing or you can be sitting, and here are the low-power poses, so you're

163
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,239
folding up, you're making yourself small.

164
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,859
This one is very low-power.

165
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:07,700
When you're touching your neck, you're really kind of protecting yourself.

166
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,619
So this is what happens.

167
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:14,979
They come in, they spit into a vial, we, for two minutes, say, you need to do this or this.

168
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,340
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

169
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,619
We don't want to prime them with a concept of power.

170
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:20,580
We want them to be feeling power, right?

171
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
So two minutes they do this.

172
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,859
We then ask them, how powerful do you feel on a series of items, and then we give them

173
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:31,380
an opportunity to gamble, and then we take another saliva sample.

174
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,380
That's it.

175
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,380
That's the whole experiment.

176
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,700
So this is what we find.

177
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling.

178
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,260
What we find is that when you're in the high-power pose condition, 86% of you will gamble.

179
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:48,020
When you're in the low-power pose condition, only 60%, and that's a pretty whopping significant

180
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
difference.

181
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,619
Here's what we find on testosterone.

182
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:58,260
From their baseline, when they come in, high-power people experience about a 20% increase, and

183
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,900
low-power people experience about a 10% decrease.

184
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,859
So again, two minutes, and you get these changes.

185
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,739
Here's what you get on cortisol.

186
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:12,659
High-power people experience about a 25% decrease, and the low-power people experience about

187
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,739
a 15% increase.

188
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:19,820
So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be

189
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,419
either assertive, confident, and comfortable, or really stress-reactive, and feeling sort

190
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,179
of shut down, and we've all had that feeling, right?

191
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:36,179
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves.

192
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:38,859
So it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.

193
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,900
Also, our bodies change our minds.

194
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,140
But the next question, of course, is can power posing for a few minutes really change

195
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,700
your life in meaningful ways?

196
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
So this is in the lab.

197
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,700
It's this little task.

198
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,940
It's just a couple of minutes.

199
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,700
Where can you actually apply this, which we cared about, of course?

200
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,580
And so we think it's really what matters, and where you want to use this is evaluative

201
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,739
situations, like social threat situations.

202
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:05,739
Where are you being evaluated?

203
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:09,780
Either by your friends, like for teenagers at the lunchroom table.

204
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,539
For some people, it's speaking at a school board meeting.

205
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:20,419
It might be giving a pitch, or giving a talk like this, or doing a job interview.

206
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:23,700
We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through

207
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,380
was the job interview.

208
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:31,700
So we published these findings, and the media are all over it, and they say, okay, so this

209
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,260
is what you do when you go in for the job interview, right?

210
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,780
So we were, of course, horrified, and said, oh, my God, no, no, no, that's not what we

211
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,419
meant at all for numerous reasons, no, no, no, don't do that.

212
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,460
Again, this is not about you talking to other people, it's you talking to yourself.

213
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,419
What do you do before you go into a job interview?

214
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,859
You do this, right?

215
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:53,340
You're sitting down, you're looking at your iPhone or your Android, not trying to leave

216
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,659
anyone out.

217
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,900
You are, you know, you're looking at your notes, you're hunching up, making yourself

218
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,500
small, when really what you should be doing maybe is this, like in the bathroom, right?

219
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Do that.

220
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Find two minutes.

221
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
So that's what we want to test, okay?

222
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,140
So you bring people into a lab, and they do either high or low-power poses again.

223
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,780
They go through a very stressful job interview.

224
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,340
It's five minutes long.

225
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,979
They are being recorded, they're being judged also, and the judges are trained to give no

226
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,739
nonverbal feedback.

227
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,820
So they look like this, like imagine this is the person interviewing you.

228
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,739
So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.

229
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,219
People hate this.

230
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:37,580
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls standing in social quicksand.

231
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,799
So this really spikes your cortisol.

232
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,260
So this is the job interview we put them through, because we really wanted to see what happened.

233
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,460
We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.

234
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,280
They're blind to the hypothesis, they're blind to the conditions, they have no idea who's

235
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,500
been posing in what pose.

236
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,340
And they end up looking at these sets of tapes, and they say, oh, we want to hire these people,

237
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,780
all the high-power posers.

238
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,679
We don't want to hire these people.

239
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,559
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall.

240
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,200
But what's driving it?

241
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,640
It's not about the content of the speech.

242
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,760
It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.

243
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,960
Because we rate them on all these variables related to sort of competence, like how well-structured

244
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,119
is the speech?

245
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,119
How good is it?

246
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,119
What are their qualifications?

247
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,799
No effect on those things.

248
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,359
This is what's affected.

249
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,880
These kinds of things.

250
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
People are bringing their true selves, basically.

251
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,119
They're bringing themselves.

252
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:35,119
They bring their ideas, but as themselves, with no residue over them.

253
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:39,960
So this is what's driving the effect or mediating the effect.

254
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,280
So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds, and our minds can

255
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,000
change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, it feels

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,119
fake, right?

257
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,679
So I said fake it till you make it.

258
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,679
It's not me.

259
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,039
I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.

260
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,599
I don't want to feel like an imposter.

261
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:03,960
I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here.

262
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,559
And that really resonated with me, because I want to tell you a little story about being

263
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,479
an imposter and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here.

264
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:14,679
When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.

265
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,960
I was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.

266
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,719
I was thrown from the car, and I woke up in a head injury rehab ward, and I had been withdrawn

267
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,080
from college.

268
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:33,039
And I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations, which was very traumatic.

269
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,119
I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted

270
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,400
as a child.

271
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,840
So I'm taken out of college.

272
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,400
I keep trying to go back.

273
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,840
They say you're not going to finish college.

274
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,159
There are other things for you to do, but that's not going to work out for you.

275
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,960
So I really struggled with this.

276
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,119
And I have to say, having your identity taken from you, your core identity, and for me it

277
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,119
was being smart, having that taken from you, there's nothing that leaves you feeling more

278
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,960
powerless than that.

279
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,159
So I felt entirely powerless.

280
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,680
I worked and worked and worked, and I got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked.

281
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,000
Eventually I graduated from college.

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,040
It took me four years longer than my peers.

283
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,239
And I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fisk, to take me on, and so I ended

284
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,880
up at Princeton, and I was like, I am not supposed to be here.

285
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,479
I am an imposter.

286
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,079
And the night before my first year talk, and the first year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute

287
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,920
talk to 20 people.

288
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
That's it.

289
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,599
I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said, I'm quitting.

290
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,880
She was like, you are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you and you're staying.

291
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,400
You're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.

292
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,719
You are going to fake it.

293
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:46,119
You're going to take, you're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do.

294
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,959
You're just going to do it and do it and do it, even if you're terrified and just paralyzed

295
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:55,359
and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say, oh my

296
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,359
gosh, I'm doing it.

297
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,119
Like, I have become this.

298
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,640
I am actually doing this.

299
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
So that's what I did.

300
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Five years in grad school.

301
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
A few years, you know, I'm at Northwestern.

302
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
I moved to Harvard.

303
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm at Harvard.

304
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking, not

305
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,880
supposed to be here, not supposed to be here.

306
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,400
So the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked in class the entire

307
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,640
semester who I had said, look, you've got to participate or else you're going to fail,

308
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
came into my office.

309
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,119
I really didn't know her at all.

310
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:36,319
And she said, she came in totally defeated, and she said, I'm not supposed to be here.

311
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,920
And that was the moment for me, because two things happened.

312
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,319
One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore, you know.

313
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,280
I don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.

314
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,920
And the second was, she is supposed to be here.

315
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,040
Like she can fake it.

316
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
She can become it.

317
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,160
So I was like, yes, you are.

318
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,040
You are supposed to be here, and tomorrow you're going to fake it.

319
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:08,599
You're going to make yourself powerful, and you know, you're going to go into the classroom,

320
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,680
and you are going to give the best comment ever, you know.

321
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,959
And she gave the best comment ever.

322
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:17,160
And people turned around, and they were like, oh my God, I didn't even notice her sitting

323
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,640
there, you know.

324
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,359
She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it until she made

325
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,359
it.

326
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,599
She had actually faked it until she became it.

327
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,479
So she had changed.

328
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:32,479
And so I want to say to you, don't fake it until you make it.

329
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,640
Fake it until you become it, you know.

330
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,439
It's not do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.

331
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:45,719
The last thing I want to leave you with is this, tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.

332
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:50,319
So this is two minutes, two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.

333
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,680
Before you go into the next stressful, evaluative situation, for two minutes, try doing this

334
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,040
in the elevator, in a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors.

335
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,560
That's what you want to do.

336
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,599
Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation.

337
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,040
Get your testosterone up.

338
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,560
Get your cortisol down.

339
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,439
Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.

340
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:14,040
Leave that situation feeling like, oh, I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who

341
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
I am.

342
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:22,520
So I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing, and also I want to ask

343
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,680
you to share the science, because this is simple.

344
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,479
I don't have ego involved in this.

345
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,479
Give it away.

346
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,800
Like, share it with people, because the people who can use it the most are the ones with

347
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,839
no resources and no technology and no status and no power.

348
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,079
Give it to them, because they can do it in private.

349
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,040
They need their bodies, privacy, and two minutes, and it can significantly change the outcomes

350
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
of their life.

351
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Thank you.

352
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Thank you.

353
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,040
